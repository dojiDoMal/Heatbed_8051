This repository contains a university project that me and two more people developed using a 8051 microcontroller. The project consists of a heatbed with controled temperature for a 3D Printer. This was developed under orientation of Professor Reinaldo Imbiriba from University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR).
# Why ?
The motive behind this project is that for the 3D Printer to properly work with a material called [ABS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene) (wich is different from the more common [PLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid)), it needs to have a heatbed as a base, since ABS has a high melting point and has the tendency to warp if cooled while printing. Thus, ABS needs to be printed on a heated bed which unfortunately is not easily available in most at-home printers. 
The final project is not only suitable for ABS but other materials since it permits a considerable high range of temperature. Other important aspect of the project is that it allows more general applications (not only for 3D Printers) that involves temperature control.
# How it works ?
